# Computer Modern Font w/ Nerd Fonts Patch

*Designed by Donald E. Knuth*


Original from [Fontsquirrel](https://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/computer-modern)
and patched using [Nerd Fonts Font
Patcher](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts#font-patcher).

## Background

I loved the font used in Knuth's Concrete Mathematics, and went searching for a
version I could use for programming and found the CMU set. Years later, I
discovered Nerd Fonts, and today I finally decided to create this patched
version for anyone to use.

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_Modern):

'''Computer Modern is the original family of typefaces used by the typesetting
program TeX.  It was created by Donald Knuth with his Metafont program, and was
most recently updated in 1992.  Computer Modern, or variants of it, remains very
widely used in scientific publishing, especially in disciplines that make
frequent use of mathematical notation.'''

'''A current extended release of the Computer Modern family in the
general-purpose OpenType format is the CMU distribution (for Computer Modern
Unicode):

- CMU Serif, the main Computer Modern font family. This includes the four
  traditional styles of font (regular, italic, bold, bold italic), and also:
  - CMU Serif upright italic, an upright italic style similar to cursive upright
    handwriting
  - CMU Serif bold non-extended, a bold weight duplexed to have the same width
    as the regular style
  - CMU Serif roman and bold slanted, two oblique styles
  - CMU Classical Serif, an italic design with slightly simpler serif designs
- Concrete Roman, a slab serif font in the four standard styles
- CMU Typewriter, a typewriter-style slab serif font
- CMU Sans Serif, a complementary sans-serif font, and CMU Bright, a lighter
  style of the same design
  - CMU Sans demi-condensed, a condensed style of the same design'''
